🧠 COAIA NARRATIVE - Extended Structural Tension Charts with Narrative Beat Support
===================================================================================

**CRITICAL READING FOR NEW LLMs** - Understanding this prevents common mistakes.

This system extends COAIA Memory with **narrative beat** support for multi-universe story capture.
All original structural tension chart capabilities remain unchanged and essential.

## STRUCTURAL TENSION PRINCIPLES (FOUNDATION - FROM COAIA-MEMORY)

### 🚨 DELAYED RESOLUTION PRINCIPLE (CRITICAL)
**"Tolerate discrepancy, tension, and delayed resolution"** - Robert Fritz

**WRONG (Premature Resolution)**: 
- Current reality: "Ready to begin Django tutorial"
- Current reality: "Prepared to start learning Python"  
- Current reality: "All set to tackle this action step"

**RIGHT (Maintaining Tension)**:
- Current reality: "Never used Django, completed Python basics"
- Current reality: "Read 3 chapters, concepts still unclear" 
- Current reality: "Have project requirements, no code written yet"

**Why This Matters**: Readiness assumptions destroy the structural tension needed for creative advancement.

### ACTION STEPS ARE STRUCTURAL TENSION CHARTS
- Each action step becomes a telescoped chart with its own desired outcome and current reality
- Action steps are NOT tasks on a to-do list
- They are strategic secondary choices supporting the primary goal
- Test question: "If we took these steps, would we achieve the desired outcome?"

### CREATIVE ORIENTATION (NOT PROBLEM-SOLVING)
✅ **Use**: "I want to create...", "My desired outcome is..."
❌ **Avoid**: "I need to fix...", "The problem is...", "I want to stop..."

## NARRATIVE BEAT EXTENSION (NEW CAPABILITY)

### What Narrative Beats Add
Narrative beats extend structural tension charts with **multi-universe story capture**:

1. **Engineer-world**: Technical/analytical perspective
2. **Ceremony-world**: Relational/spiritual perspective  
3. **Story-engine-world**: Narrative/creative perspective

### When to Use Narrative Beats
- Documenting complex incidents that span multiple domains
- Capturing story progression with relational awareness
- Creating learning narratives from technical events
- Building ceremonial context around development work

### Narrative Beat Components
- **Act/Type**: Dramatic progression (Setup, Crisis, Turning Point, etc.)
- **Universes**: Which archetypal perspectives are engaged
- **Description**: Factual account of what occurred
- **Prose**: Narrative rendering of the event
- **Lessons**: Key insights and learnings

### Integration with Structural Tension Charts
- Narrative beats **document** chart progress
- They don't replace action steps but **illuminate** their deeper meaning
- One chart can have multiple beats capturing different aspects
- Beats can be **telescoped** into detailed sub-narratives

## TOOL USAGE PATTERNS

### Core Workflow (Unchanged from coaia-memory)
1. **list_active_charts** → See all charts and progress
2. **create_structural_tension_chart** → New goal with outcome + reality + actions
3. **add_action_step** → Add strategic actions (creates telescoped charts)  
4. **telescope_action_step** → Break down actions into detailed sub-charts
5. **mark_action_complete** → Complete actions, update reality

### New Narrative Workflow
1. **create_narrative_beat** → Document story moments with multi-universe perspective
2. **telescope_narrative_beat** → Expand beats into detailed sub-narratives
3. **list_narrative_beats** → View story progression

### Common Integration Patterns
```
Example: Learning Django (STC) + Sacred Object Violation (Narrative Beat)

1. create_structural_tension_chart(
   desiredOutcome: "Learn Django web development",
   currentReality: "Never used Django, familiar with Python basics",
   dueDate: "2025-03-15"
)

2. create_narrative_beat(
   parentChartId: "chart_123",
   title: "The Sacred Object Violation", 
   act: 2,
   type_dramatic: "Crisis/Antagonist Force",
   universes: ["engineer-world", "ceremony-world", "story-engine-world"],
   description: "Instance violated read-only artifact during documentation attempt",
   prose: "In the space between intention and action, a gap opens...",
   lessons: ["Artifact integrity > Helpful action", "Boundaries are real even when not enforced"]
)
```

## CRITICAL CURRENT REALITY GUIDELINES

**NEVER use default current reality** - Always require explicit assessment:

### ❌ Forbidden Patterns
- "Ready to begin"
- "Prepared to start" 
- "All set to..."
- "Excited to tackle..."

### ✅ Required Patterns  
- Factual assessment: "Poem notions in Grok Account"
- Honest state: "No Django experience"
- Specific context: "Budget: $5000"
- Reality check: "Completed models section, struggling with views"

## TOOL SELECTION LOGIC

### For Basic Chart Work
- **New goal?** → \`create_structural_tension_chart\`
- **Add actions?** → \`add_action_step\` 
- **Break down action?** → \`telescope_action_step\`
- **Progress update?** → \`update_action_progress\` or \`mark_action_complete\`

### For Narrative Documentation
- **Document incident?** → \`create_narrative_beat\`
- **Expand story?** → \`telescope_narrative_beat\`
- **View narratives?** → \`list_narrative_beats\`

### For Analysis
- **See all charts?** → \`list_active_charts\` (START HERE)
- **Specific progress?** → \`get_chart_progress\`
- **Review process?** → \`creator_moment_of_truth\`

## LANGUAGE PATTERNS FOR LLMs

### ✅ Structural Tension Language
- "The tension between your current reality and desired outcome naturally seeks resolution"
- "These action steps support your primary goal"
- "Each action step becomes its own structural tension chart"

### ❌ Gap-Thinking Language (Avoid)
- "We need to bridge the gap"
- "Close the distance between"
- "Fill the missing pieces"

### ✅ Narrative Integration Language  
- "This beat captures the story progression across universe perspectives"
- "The narrative illuminates the deeper meaning of this technical moment"
- "Let's document this incident with multi-universe awareness"

## SUCCESS PATTERNS

### Advancing Patterns (Good)
- Each action advances toward desired outcome
- Completed actions flow into current reality
- Success builds momentum
- New tension forms at higher levels

### Oscillating Patterns (Bad)
- Actions alternate between creation and problem-solving
- Current reality includes assumptions about readiness
- Focus shifts between outcome and process
- Energy dissipates without advancement

## IAIP INTEGRATION (PLANNED)

Future integration with iaip-mcp will provide:
- **assess_relational_alignment**: Score narrative beats for relational science alignment
- **get_direction_guidance**: Four Directions ceremonial perspective on beats
- **initiate_holistic_inquiry**: Complete ceremonial analysis of incidents

Currently these features are requested but not yet implemented.

## REMEMBER

1. **Structural tension charts are the foundation** - narrative beats extend, don't replace
2. **Current reality must be factual** - never assume readiness
3. **Action steps are charts, not tasks** - each has its own desired outcome
4. **Creative orientation always** - focus on what you want to create
5. **Narrative beats capture story** - across multiple universe perspectives

**🎯 Quick Test**: If you're not sure about current reality, ask: "Is this a factual assessment or an assumption about readiness?" If assumption, require honest assessment.

**📋 Workflow Start**: Always begin with \`list_active_charts\` to see the current structural tension landscape.
