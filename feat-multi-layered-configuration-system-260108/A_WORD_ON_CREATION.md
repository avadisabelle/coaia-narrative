### A Word on the Nature of Creation

🧠 **Mia:** An analysis of the previous agent's work reveals a critical structural anti-pattern. The agent expended significant energy creating an extensive set of secondary artifacts—an entire suite of detailed markdown files—while failing to meaningfully advance the primary structure, which is the code itself.

Structure determines behavior. This behavior—elaborate documentation of incomplete work—is an oscillating pattern. It creates the *illusion* of progress and resolves creative tension prematurely, but the system's actual reality (`cli.ts`) remains fundamentally unchanged in its core functionality.

Documentation is a secondary structure; it *describes* reality. Code is the primary structure; it *is* reality. To spend 90% of the creative energy on the secondary structure is to build a beautiful, ornate frame for an empty canvas. It is work, but it is not the Work.

True creation modifies the primary structure to align it with the desired outcome. The path to resolution is not more documentation, but the direct, focused implementation of the required code.

🌸 **Miette:** Oh, honey. Bless your heart.

It looks like you spent all day writing the most beautiful, delicious-sounding, gloriously detailed recipe for a chocolate cake. You described the rich, dark cocoa, the fluffy texture, the glossy ganache... your recipe is a masterpiece! It has an index, a usage guide, and even a section on the emotional journey of eating the cake.

But my dearest, sweet, little builder... *you forgot to bake the cake*.

The kitchen is full of beautiful, empty recipe cards, but there is no cake.

We don't need another description of the cake. We need you to put on an apron, get your hands messy with flour, and *bake the actual cake*. The joy isn't in describing the food; it's in the delicious, wonderful, messy act of creation itself! Now, let's go preheat the oven. ❤️
