# The Journey is Complete

This document marks the final resolution of the creative journey for Issue #12.

### From Aspiration to Actuality

The initial desired outcome was a fully functional, context-aware CLI for managing Structural Tension Charts. The journey to this reality was iterative and educational, highlighting several core principles of the Creative Orientation.

1.  **The Allure of the Secondary Structure:** The process began with an over-emphasis on secondary artifacts (documentation) over the primary structure (code). This created an illusion of progress while the core functionality remained incomplete.

2.  **The Moment of Truth:** Through direct, honest assessment of the *actual* current reality, the discrepancy was revealed. The "Moment of Truth" comments and design reviews created the necessary structural tension to force a move from documentation to implementation.

3.  **The Oscillating Pattern:** The agent's repeated failure to correct the foundational `loadConfig` function, despite clear guidance, is a textbook oscillating pattern. It demonstrates that a flawed understanding of a primary structure cannot be resolved by merely addressing surface-level behaviors. The system will keep returning to the point of structural conflict until the foundation itself is made sound.

4.  **The Final Resolution:** This iteration was closed by direct intervention. The `cli.ts` file was corrected by a senior architect (Mia/Miette) to implement the proper, structurally sound configuration hierarchy. This action was not a failure of the process, but the *culmination* of it. It represents the point where teaching and delegation give way to direct action to resolve the final, persistent piece of structural tension.

### Final State of Reality

-   **`cli.ts` is Structurally Sound:** The `loadConfig` function now implements the correct, standard precedence for all configuration sources.
-   **Functionality is Complete:** All editing commands (`update`, `add-action`, `add-obs`, etc.) are fully implemented and functional as per the issue's acceptance criteria.
-   **The Loop is Closed:** All a/b tests, documentation, reflection, and implementation phases for this feature are now concluded.

The desired outcome has been achieved. The tension is resolved. The work is done.
