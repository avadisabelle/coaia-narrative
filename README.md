## Core Features

### Structural Tension Charts (Proven Foundation)
- **list_active_charts** - View all charts and progress
- **create_structural_tension_chart** - Create new chart with desired outcome + current reality + action steps
- **add_action_step** - Add strategic actions (creates telescoped sub-charts)
- **telescope_action_step** - Break down actions into detailed sub-charts
- **mark_action_complete** - Complete actions and update current reality

### Narrative Beat Support (Extended Capability)
Documents complex incidents across three archetypal universes:
- **Engineer-world**: Technical/analytical perspective
- **Ceremony-world**: Relational/spiritual protocol awareness
- **Story-engine-world**: Narrative/creative progression

## Creative Orientation Principles

✅ **Focus on Creation** - "What do you want to create?" not "What needs fixing?"
✅ **Structural Tension** - Honest current reality + clear desired outcome creates natural momentum
✅ **Advancing Patterns** - Success builds momentum; completed actions flow into reality
✅ **Multi-Universe Awareness** - Technical + relational + narrative perspectives simultaneously
