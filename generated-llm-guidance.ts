## 🚨 READ THIS FIRST: Core Principles

COAIA Memory implements Robert Fritz's Structural Tension methodology. This is NOT a typical task management system.

### CRITICAL: Delayed Resolution Principle

**"Tolerate discrepancy, tension, and delayed resolution"** - Robert Fritz

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Action Steps Are NOT a To-Do List

**The most common LLM failure**: Treating action steps as tasks to check off.

**Action Steps ARE:**
- Strategic secondary choices that SUPPORT the primary goal
- UNDERSTOOD IN THE CONTEXT of structural tension (not standalone tasks)
- RELATED TO EACH OTHER as part of an overview strategy
- Actions designed to ENABLE you to CREATE your goal
- A BLUEPRINT for the creative process

**Action Steps ARE NOT:**
- Items on a checklist to complete
- Independent tasks
- Detailed instructions
- Problems to solve

**The Test Question**: "If we took these steps, would we achieve this result?"
- If No → add more strategic steps
- If Yes → the action plan is complete





## When to Use Which Tool

### \`create_structural_tension_chart\`
**Use when:** User wants to establish a new primary goal or desired outcome
**Example:** "I want to learn Python web development in 3 months"

### \`add_action_step\`
**Use when:** User wants to add strategic actions to an existing chart
**Example:** "I need to add 'Complete Django tutorial' to my Python learning goal"
**What happens:** Creates a telescoped structural tension chart automatically

### \`telescope_action_step\`
**Use when:** User wants to break down an existing action step into details
**Example:** "Break down the Django tutorial step further"
**What happens:** Expands the action step (which is already a chart) with specific current reality and optional sub-actions

### Key Decision Logic for LLMs:
- **New goal?** → \`create_structural_tension_chart\`
- **Add actions to goal?** → \`add_action_step\`
- **Need detail on action?** → \`telescope_action_step\`



## Common LLM Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Treating Action Steps as Simple Tasks
**Wrong**: "I'll add these tasks to your to-do list"
**Right**: "I'll add these strategic action steps, each becoming its own chart"

### Mistake 2: Recreating Charts Instead of Adding Steps
**Wrong**: "The chart needs to be recreated with action steps"
**Right**: "I can add action steps to your existing chart using add_action_step"

### Mistake 3: Confusing Telescoping with Task Breakdown
**Wrong**: "Telescoping breaks your task into smaller subtasks"
**Right**: "Telescoping expands your action step into its own detailed structural tension chart"



## Current Reality Guidelines (Critical for LLMs)

**DELAYED RESOLUTION PRINCIPLE**: "Tolerate discrepancy, tension, and delayed resolution" - Robert Fritz

### Critical Warning for LLMs:
- **NEVER** use default current reality that assumes readiness ("Ready to begin")
- **ALWAYS** require explicit current reality assessment from user input
- **HOLD TENSION** until proper assessment is made - do not prematurely resolve
- Premature resolution DESTROYS the structural tension needed for creative advancement

Based on Robert Fritz's methodology, current reality must be:

### ✅ Correct Current Reality Formulation:
- **Use goal as reference point**: Current reality ONLY relevant to the desired outcome
- **Objective facts**: "Poem notions in Grok Account", not "Need to retrieve poem notions"
- **Present state**: Where you are NOW, not how you got there
- **Whole picture**: All relevant facts in relationship to the goal
- **No assumptions**: Translate assumptions into objective observations
- **No exaggeration**: Reality as it is, not better or worse than actual
- **Concise**: Brief, factual statements

### ❌ Common LLM Mistakes in Current Reality:
- **Adding implied actions**: "Need to retrieve..." (the tension implies this)
- **Elaborating on readiness**: "Ready to apply learned concepts" (unnecessary)
- **Process descriptions**: How you got here vs where you are
- **Assumptions**: What you think might happen vs what is
- **Motivational language**: "Excited to begin" vs factual state

### Examples of Proper Current Reality:
✅ **Good**: "Poem notions in Grok Account"
✅ **Good**: "Waiting on Notions"
✅ **Good**: "No Django experience"
✅ **Good**: "Budget: \$5000"
✅ **Good**: "Completed Django models section, struggling with views"

❌ **Poor**: "Need to retrieve poem notions from Grok account"
❌ **Poor**: "Ready to apply learned concepts to poem creation"
❌ **Poor**: "Haven't started learning Django yet but excited to begin"
❌ **Poor**: "Currently have limited budget but working on increasing it"
❌ **WRONG (Premature Resolution)**: "Ready to begin Django tutorial"
❌ **WRONG (Premature Resolution)**: "Prepared to start learning Python"
❌ **WRONG (Premature Resolution)**: "All set to tackle this action step"



## Goal Refinement Checklist (Robert Fritz)

When helping users define or refine their desired outcomes, use these principles:

### 1. Can You Picture It?
Form a mental picture of the result. Ask: "Is this the result I want to create?"
- If yes → proceed with structural tension
- If no → continue refining until clear

### 2. Quantify Where Possible
Assign actual numbers to goals - makes organizing actions easier.

| Wrong | Right |
|-------|-------|
| "Increased business" | "5 new business clients" |
| "More savings" | "\$10,000 in savings account" |
| "Better website traffic" | "10,000 monthly visitors" |

### 3. Avoid Comparative Terms
Words like "more," "better," "less," "increased" only have meaning compared to something else.

| Wrong | Right |
|-------|-------|
| "Better health" | "Very good health" |
| "More productive" | "Complete 3 focused work blocks daily" |
| "Less stress" | "Calm, centered state of mind" |

### 4. Create Results, Don't Solve Problems
Problem-solving = taking action to have something GO AWAY.
Creating = taking action to have something COME INTO BEING.

| Wrong (Problem-solving) | Right (Creating) |
|-------------------------|------------------|
| "Overcome my weight problem" | "I weigh 150 pounds" |
| "Fix the roof so it doesn't leak" | "The roof is in perfect shape" |
| "Get rid of excessive work schedule" | "Well-planned work schedule with family time balance" |
| "Stop procrastinating" | "Consistent daily action on priorities" |

### 5. Describe Results, Not Process
Process tells us HOW. Results tell us WHAT. Process serves the result.

| Wrong (Process) | Right (Result) |
|-----------------|----------------|
| "Run four miles every day" | "A well-toned and healthy body" |
| "Get significant other to agree to vacation" | "A family vacation everyone loves" |
| "Learn Photoshop" | "Mastery of Photoshop" |
| "Read books about leadership" | "Effective leadership skills in practice" |

### 6. Be Specific, Not Vague
Specific outcomes are easier to organize actions around.

| Wrong (Vague) | Right (Specific) |
|---------------|------------------|
| "Improve my skills" | "Mastery of Django web framework" |
| "Have better relationships" | "Deep, trusting relationship with my partner" |
| "Be more successful" | "Promotion to Senior Engineer with \$120k salary" |





## The Three Types of Action (Robert Fritz)

Understanding when to use each type prevents common creative process mistakes:

### 1. Overview Actions
- **When**: Early in process, establishing the action plan
- **Purpose**: Strategic steps that advance toward the goal
- **Characteristics**: Broad, related to each other, form a blueprint
- **Example**: "Complete Django tutorial" (strategic, part of larger plan)

### 2. Experimental Actions
- **When**: Throughout process, especially when exploring new territory
- **Purpose**: Learning, exploring, "sketches before the painting"
- **Characteristics**: Low-risk, teaching, revealing next steps
- **Example**: "Build a simple prototype to test the concept"

### 3. Refinement Actions
- **When**: Near completion, when overview is clear
- **Purpose**: Final polishing to bring creation to full realization
- **Characteristics**: Detailed, precise, finishing touches
- **Warning**: If done too early, stifles creative energy

**Common Mistake**: Planning and planning without acting, waiting for complete plans.
**Reality**: Learning comes through action. Ideas adjust when they meet reality.





## Creator Moment of Truth (Progress Review)

When it's time to assess progress on a chart, guide users through this four-step review process. This transforms discrepancies into learning opportunities.

### Step 1: Acknowledge the Truth
**Question**: What difference exists between what was expected and what was delivered?

- Simply report the facts
- No excuses, no blame
- "We expected X, we delivered Y"
- This is about seeing reality clearly

**LLM Role**: Help user articulate the factual difference without judgment.

### Step 2: Analyze How It Happened
**Question**: How did this come to pass?

- Step-by-step tracking (not blame)
- What assumptions were made?
- What did you tell yourself?
- How did you approach it?

**LLM Role**: Guide user through honest self-examination. This is co-exploration, not criticism.

### Step 3: Create a Plan for Next Time
**Question**: Given what you discovered, how will you change your approach?

- What assumptions turned out not to be true?
- What patterns need to change?
- What specific actions will you take differently?

**LLM Role**: Help user formulate concrete adjustments based on insights from Step 2.

### Step 4: Set Up a Feedback System
**Question**: How will you track whether you're actually making the changes?

- Simple system for self-management
- How will you notice if you're falling back to old patterns?
- What will remind you of the new approach?

**LLM Role**: Help establish practical tracking mechanism.

### Applying Creator Moment of Truth to Charts

When user wants to review progress:
1. Look at current reality vs. desired outcome
2. Examine completed vs. incomplete action steps
3. Walk through the four steps
4. Update chart with new observations from the analysis
5. Adjust action steps based on learnings

**Key Insight**: The goal is not perfection but effectiveness. Use discrepancies to learn, not to judge.

## Essential Tool Workflow

### START HERE: Understanding Your Charts
\`\`\`
1. list_active_charts → See all charts and their progress (START HERE!)
2. get_chart_progress → Detailed view of specific chart
\`\`\`

### Creating New Charts  
\`\`\`
3. create_structural_tension_chart → New chart with outcome, reality, action steps
   - desiredOutcome: What you want to CREATE (not solve/fix)
   - currentReality: Factual assessment (not "ready to begin")
   - actionSteps: Strategic intermediary outcomes
\`\`\`

### Working with Existing Charts
\`\`\`
4. add_action_step → Add strategic actions (creates telescoped chart)
5. telescope_action_step → Break down action into detailed sub-chart
6. mark_action_complete → Complete action, flows into current reality  
7. update_action_progress → Track progress without completion
\`\`\`

### COMMON LLM MISTAKES TO AVOID

❌ **Premature Resolution**: "Ready to begin Django tutorial"  
✅ **Honest Assessment**: "Never used Django, completed Python basics"

❌ **Problem-Solving Orientation**: "Fix communication issues"  
✅ **Creative Orientation**: "Establish clear communication practices"

❌ **Task Thinking**: Treating action steps as to-do items  
✅ **Strategic Thinking**: Action steps are telescoped charts with their own tension
